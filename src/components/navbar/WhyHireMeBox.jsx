        <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-white mb-6">
         I believe you should hire me because I have a strong foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. During my internship, I gained hands-on experience building real projects, creating responsive user interfaces, and implementing API integrations. This helped me apply my skills in a practical setting and improve my coding abilities.

I am dedicated, eager to learn, and ready to contribute from day one. Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity where I can grow further while delivering real-world solutions.
